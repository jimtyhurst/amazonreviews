We sent them back after seeing them, the quality was very poor, example, the needle nose pliers do not even touch each other to get a good grip. The wire cutters were the same and could not cut the wire due to a sizable gap between the snippers :( disappointed	2015-08-31

I was a little concerned because when I turn it on you can see sparks through the air vent holes in the handle.  I was thinking it might be defective, but it kept working fine sanding the parameter of an entire bedroom hardwood floor.  The electric motor brushes must need to break in?  Gave it 4 stars because of the sparks.  With the sparks I will keep it away for anything potentially combustible (IE boat bilge or oil based paints) without a lot of ventilation.  I hooked it up to my shop vac so dust was minimized.	2015-08-31

It is very difficult to find decent gloves to fit a woman's hand. All women's gloves I have seen are worthy only of potting plants, not real work. I'd been using a very similar looking, small, men's leather gloves from a big-box store, but the fingers would wear out very quickly.  These have been great so far. I love the extra piece of leather on the first two fingers and the thumb, which is where the others always wore out. There is a little extra padding on the palm and knuckles. The padding may make them a little warmer than typical light-duty gloves. The side of the forefinger is reinforced as well. The construction overall is very good.  The small size fits my hands (which are med/large women's size) well, although it is a tad bit bigger than my usual brand. I am very happy so far and will follow up in time when they are used more.  Update: 5 Months later and they are holding up great. I have been doing a lot of shoveling and working with chicken wire, cement blocks and gravel. They have been used in both wet and dry situations.	2015-08-31
